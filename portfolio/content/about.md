# About Me

Hi, I am Ritik Ranjan (AKA Ranjan) from India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³.

Male, 19. I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at [Galgotias University](https://www.galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/)

I am a Full Stack Developer and a Competitive Programmer. I am a self-taught programmer and I love to learn new things. I am a quick learner and a good team player. I am a hard-working person and I love to work on challenging projects.

I don't believe in taking the right decision; instead, I take a decision and then make it right. Embracing a proactive and adaptive approach to problem-solving.
