Hey there! Welcome to the world of Galgotias University, where the excitement of joining coding and entrepreneurship clubs can sometimes lead to unexpected surprises. Today, let's uncover what's really going on behind the scenes, shedding light on the truths that might be hidden from plain sight.

**Big Promises, New Students Beware:**
As you step into the world of college, some clubs might try to woo you with big and fancy promises of learning and growth. But beware! Some of these clubs charge you fees (30 Rs.) without giving much in return. It's like buying a ticket to a show and realizing the performance is not as great as advertised.

Club heads/recruiters say, "We will teach you, HOW TO ...", "You will get to learn ...", "You will get to know ...", "You will get to meet ...", "You will get to work with ...", "You will get to work on ...", etc., etc., etc. and I must say, the way they speak is remarkable, I mean it's kinda influential. But, the reality is, they don't do anything. They just talk, talk, and talk. They don't do anything. They don't teach you anything.

**Entrepreneur Cell: Fact or Fiction?**
There's a club called the Entrepreneur Cell (E Cell) that claims to be a hub of startup success. They say they've helped create over 100+ startups, but where are these success stories? Students are wondering if these claims are real or just stories without proof. There is no discussion of any real startups, and the club seems to be more about talking than doing. I talked about it to many seniors of mine, and they all said the same thing, "It's a waste of time". But some of them actually admire the club, and they are the ones who are actually doing something. They do have some IDEAS running in their mind. But, "100 baat ki ek baat", are just ideas, nothing more than that. I really wish they do something about their idea, maybe get funded, and make it a reality. Surely they will get a lot of support from the club.

**Camcircle & GRAPHEX: A Bright Spot:**
Now, let's talk about Camcircle—a club focused on photography and graphic design. Unlike some other clubs, Camcircle doesn't just talk the talk; they walk the walk. Their work is not just impressive; it's celebrated by everyone, making them stand out in a good way. Their pictures are so good. The photographers are actually talented, I have seen their groundwork. Their Instagram page does have high-quality pictures (and videos) and they are very active.

Getting into that club is pretty "hard" too. I have heard, them say, "You can only get into that club if you own a professional DSLR camera". I don't know if it's true or not, but I have seen some of the members of that club, and they do have a DSLR camera. I don't know if it's a coincidence or not, but it's true.

**Humanity Saviours: A Club of Humanity:**
This is yet another club. They are actually nice. This club is actually a "HUMAN SAVIOUR" but more likely an "ENVIRONMENT SAVIOUR". Their events are good. And the thing they do makes anyone happy. Like, they did "Plant-O-Mania" (They took `a step forward to plant 100 trees`), "Forever Young", "The Blanket Campaign – Warm Soul" (`to help the poor in distress protect themselves on the bitterly cold streets of Delhi`). I really appreciate their work. They are doing a great job. I wish them all the best for their future events.

**Technojam: A Club of Empty Promises:**
As the name suggests the club should be holding coding contest(s), like, CTF(s) or Hackathon(s), or maybe even a coding competition. But, they don't do anything, except host seminars and take "Auditions", it's like an interview; I doubt if our seniors even know what `DBMS` stands for, Anyways, they do have "a lot of sponsors", which I have no idea, what they do. The point is, they are pretty much useless.

**More Members, Less Quality:**
Imagine you join a club, excited to be part of something big, only to realize they care more about having lots of members than actually doing cool stuff. That's what's happening in some clubs at Galgotias University. It's like a big group where everyone joins, but nobody really does anything cool together.

**What's Next? Real Skills, Real Fun:**
In the end, students are calling for a change. They want to focus on things that really matter, like learning new skills and having fun doing it. It's time to move away from the hype of social media and focus on platforms like HackerRank and GitHub, where real skills are developed.

Let's forget about all the hype and focus on what really matters—learning cool stuff and having fun while doing it. It's time to switch from social media streaks to places like HackerRank and GitHub, where we can actually build real skills.

In the journey of learning and growing, let's keep our eyes open and question what's presented to us. It's time to create a culture of honesty, where everyone is transparent about what they're doing. After all, real growth happens when we're true to ourselves and committed to building skills that truly make a difference.

I don't completely blame club heads, some of them are my friends. They really put some serious effort into an event to be successful. Sometimes it's also about the management. Moreover, it's us. We are responsible for it. One must believe in themselves and their skills. If you are good at something, you don't need to be in a club to prove it.

Getting into a club is not a big deal. I don't know what students are actually thinking, "Oh I am into so and so club, now I will be having many friends and will get famous". FK! No, it doesn't work like that. You need to be good at something.

At the time of placement, no one will ask you, "Hey, you were in so and so club, right?". They will ask you, "What can you do?". So, focus on your skills, not on clubs. If you are good at something, you will get noticed, and you will get what you deserve.

I am not saying, don't join clubs. Join them, but don't expect anything from them. If you are good at something, you will get noticed, and you will get what you deserve.

PEACE!
